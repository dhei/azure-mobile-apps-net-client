## Managed Windows Client SDK

Our managed portable library for Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, Windows Phone 8.1, and Windows Runtime Universal C# Client SDK makes it incredibly easy to use Mobile Services from your Windows applications. The [Microsoft Azure Mobile Services SDK](http://nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.MobileServices/) is available
as a Nuget package or you can download the source using the instructions above. The managed portable library also supports the full .NET 4.5 platform.

### Prerequisites

The SDK requires Visual Studio 2013.

### Building and Referencing the SDK

The managed portable library solution includes a core portable assembly and platform-specific assemblies for each of the supported platforms: Windows 8,
Windows Phone 8 and .NET 4.5. The core portable platform project is ```Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile```. The platform-specific assembly projects are
named using a ```Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.Ext.<Platform>``` convention. The Windows Phone 8 platform also
include a ```Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.UI.<Platform>``` project that contain UI components. To build the Managed Portable Libray:

1. Open the ```Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.Managed_Windows.sln``` solution file in Visual Studio 2013.
2. Press F6 to build the solution.

### Running the Tests

The managed portable library ```Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.Managed_Windows.sln``` has a test application for each of the supported platforms: Windows 8,
Windows Phone 8 and .NET 4.5.

1. Open the ```Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.Managed_Windows.sln``` solution file in Visual Studio 2013.
2. Right-click on the test project for a given platform in the Solution Explorer and select ```Set as StartUp Project```.
3. Press F5 to run the application in debug mode.
4. An application will appear with a prompt for a runtime Uri and Tags. You can safely ignore this prompt and just click the Start button.
5. The test suite will run and display the results.
